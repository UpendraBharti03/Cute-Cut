                <p>Born and raised in Homewood, Elizabeth joined the Cute Cut family after a career in management, and we have loved her since! She will strike up a conversation with a perfect stranger and will leave with a best friend. She is most passionate about her relationships with people, especially children, and looks forward to summertime when she can volunteer at her favorite day camp – Sawyerville. When she's not at work, she can be found near a body of water or watching Game of Thrones, anything on Bravo, or Big Mouth with her fiancé Sean and her dog Scilla.</p>

                <p>Fashion queen Kinsha has been in the retail business for over 20 years. She has been going to the salon since she was a little girl, but had never worked in one, until now! She brought her many talents, her bubbly personality, and sassy charm to Cute Cut and we have loved her ever since! When she isn’t working you can find her at a restaurant eating something delicious or at home with her delicious husband Anthony.</p>

                <p>Leza is passionate about creating unique hair and makeup looks for her clients at Cute Cut, after living part of her life in Hawaii where she was a professional photographer and makeup artist. Her experience in portrait photography, knowledge of transformation through hair and makeup, and belief in the Aveda philosophy motivated her to experience life in a new direction. She joined the team as the very first apprentice when the Cute Cut opened and has been with us since. Along the journey, she trained under many notable Aveda makeup and hair artists.</p>

                <p>Mandy always had a passion for fashion, makeup, and art, so naturally she was drawn to a career where she could utilize all three. She joined the team in 2013 and is one of the salon's most in-demand stylists. Though she loves all facets of cutting and coloring, her favorite part of each day is interacting and building meaningful relationships with her clients. Scheduling with Mandy in advance is strongly advised because her clientele base is vast. Aside from hair, her other passion is her family.</p>
